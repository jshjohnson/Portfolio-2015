<p>I'm going to be honest, mastering JavaScript has been on the top of my front-end-developer-bucket-list for as long as I can remember. The JS clique on Twitter seem to be having a right good time over in the land of scripts, and I want a slice of that pie. Unfortunately, I find it to be a language that moves so fast, and at such a frequency, it is difficult and somewhat off-putting to ride the bandwagon. Rarely a week goes by where a new irrelevant word isn't put in front of that ".js" that promises to solve another problem I never actually knew I had.</p>
<p>Credit where credit is due though, JavaScript is exciting. It has grown up, it's client-side, it's server-side, it's MVC, it's great. Yet it seems to be heavily influenced by fad and as a consequence, it carries a lot of opinionated baggage regarding the "right" way of doing things. It shouldn't be this way. Tools do not dictate the success of an application or website. As<a title="Scott Riley" href="http://scottrileydesigns.co.uk/posts/fuck-you-and-fuck-your-tools"> Scott Riley</a> states, tools and technologies are merely "a means to an end, a method of realising an idea". If PHP works for you, great - I like it too, don't feel that you <em>need</em> to learn libraries like Node, Ember and Angular for example, when the language you are comfortable with works for you. You may be being ignorant in claiming what you are using is all things to all people, however for you to progress as a developer (or as a human even), you need to learn <em>why </em>certain aspects of our work great for certain situations and why some were just not cut out for what you are looking for. Every language has its fair share of issues, don't be led to believe the cutting edge JS library you <em>need</em> to learn will be flawless because it just won't.</p>
<p>Douglas Crockford of PayPal believes "JavaScript is the only language people feel like they don't need to learn to use". You can see where he is coming from - there are many websites out there that have been bastardised by their developers lack of JS knowledge. I do not think however that people refuse to learn the language out of laziness; I believe the language and its community has evolved to such an extent, it's hard for someone new to the game to even dip their toes into the language without feeling the self-doubt when discovering they are not doing things the "right" way (even when the tools/syntax/language you are using are working for you). Don't get me wrong, the constant evolution of the web and it's technologies is both vital and great. It just feels like trends in the JS community are perhaps fluctuating <em>too</em> much when there are not enough hours in a day to learn why one might need to join the craze in the first place.</p>
<p>Many hours needs to be invested to learn these great tools, I think people are too fixated on being at the cutting edge of things when time could be better spent improving the tools we already have.js</p>
