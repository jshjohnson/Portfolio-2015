<p>Having benefitted so much from the open source community in my career; I thought it would be rude to carry on without open-sourcing something of my own!</p>
<p>Having worked on various projects that utilities animations and animation events, it made sense to culminate the various variations of animation handling scripts I had written into one succinct, configurable plugin.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I have released a tiny JavaScript plugin that makes triggering element animations based on an event a breeze. Whether you want to fade in an element on page load or make an element bounce when it enters the viewport, animate.js has got you covered.</p>
<p>To get started, simply include the plugin, create a new instance and initialise away:</p>
<pre class="pre pre--overflow"><code>&lt;script src="/assets/js/dist/animate.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
    var animate = new Animate({
        target: '[data-animate]',
        animatedClass: 'js-animated',
        offset: 0.5,
        delay: 0,
        removeAnimations: true,
        reverse: false,
        debug: false,
        onLoad: true,
        onScroll: true,
        onResize: false,
        callback: function (element) {
            console.log(element)
        }
    });
    animate.init();
&lt;/script></code></pre>
<p>As I believe the best way to learn JavaScript is to scrutinise other people's code, here is a breakdown of what is happening beneath the hood:</p>
