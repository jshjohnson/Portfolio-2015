<p>Having benefitted so much from the open source community in my career; I thought it would be rude to carry on without open-sourcing something of my own!</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I have released <a href="https://joshuajohnson.co.uk/animate/"><em>animate.js</em></a>; a tiny JavaScript plugin that makes triggering element animations based on an event a breeze. Whether you want to fade in an element on page load or make an element bounce when it enters the viewport, <em>animate.js</em> has got you covered.</p>
<p>To get started, simply include the plugin, create a new instance and fire the initialise method:</p>
<pre class="pre pre--overflow"><code>&lt;script src="/assets/js/dist/animate.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;script>
    var animate = new Animate({
        target: '[data-animate]',
        animatedClass: 'js-animated',
        offset: 0.5,
        delay: 0,
        removeAnimations: true,
        reverse: false,
        debug: false,
        onLoad: true,
        onScroll: true,
        onResize: false,
        callbackOnInit: function(){},
        callbackOnAnimate: function(element){
            console.log(element);
        }
    });
    animate.init();
&lt;/script></code></pre>
<p>Once the plugin is initialised, all that is required to animate an element is to add the target attribute/class ('data-animate' by default) as well as the animations you wish to add:</p>
<pre class="pre pre--overflow">
&lt;div data-animate data-animation-classes="animated fadeIn">&lt;/div>
</pre>
