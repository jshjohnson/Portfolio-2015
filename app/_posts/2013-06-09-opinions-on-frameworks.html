<p>Let me rewind back a few months. I was immersing myself in among the greatness of RWD and SASS and was spending my free time making my code look pretty and above all, decent. I was itching to get my dirty mitts on a project where I could exert my newly gained skills.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short; I was approached by an agency in London soon after, asking me to turn an, already fixed width, website into a responsive, fluid website. By all means, a royal pain in the arse but not something I was prepared to turn my new-to-the-game nose at.</p>
<p>Shortly after beginning the tedious task of scanning the already written code to understand what was going on, shit hit the fan.</p>
<p>This website was using the bloated, chubby kid in the corner - Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
<p>Now I have always made a conscious effort to learn in depth as to how code works so that I can write it myself without worry. I felt strongly that using someone else's code was giving a man a fish without teaching him how to catch one himself. In a roundabout way, cutting corners.</p>
<p>I completed my side of the project eventually, but was forced to take out large chunks of code that did nothing, did too much or just made no sense. Leaving me to rewrite chunks of code that I hadn't been asked to do or paid for.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say I hated frameworks, their intentions are good (OOCSS is a sound concept) but I definitely did not enjoy working with one.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks and I was working for Mixd, an agency in Harrogate on a graduate placement.</p>
<p>Dun, dun dun... They used a framework. In fact, they used a framework for CSS <em>and</em> WordPress. I was beginning to feel that all the time spent learning the inns and outs of code could have been better spent learning a framework back to front.</p>
<p>That was naive of me though. I had dipped my toe in a pool of water and quickly ran off with my tail between my legs. I hadn't allowed myself to immerse in a framework - I had simply ousted its workings to aid what I already knew.</p>
<p>It turns out that a well structured framework with sensible code can significantly increase workflow speed to such an extent that my most recent portfolio redesign was built using the <a href="https://github.com/Mixd/Mixd-CSS-Framework" target="_blank">Mixd CSS framework</a>.</p>
<h2>What's changed?</h2>
<p>I now know that time wasn't wasted learning how code works. That was essential. I still need to know what code I'm using and why; I just had to learn what classes held the code I needed so I could reuse them over and over again whilst taking half the time. I also made an effort to add classes that I regularly use but are not part of the framework to enrich the framework further.</p>
<p>Think of it as a preprocessor for workflows.</p>
<p>As it is a framework that has no intentions to appeal to the audience Twitter Bootstrap waves its hands at, it did not have the bloated, unnecessary code that front-end developers rarely use. It just had the code you regularly repeat on projects, meaning you do not have to rewrite code from scratch every time, for example, an element needs a 1em margin beneath it.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that there are a lot of developers out there using frameworks because they don't know how things work; they have just taught themselves that if they use a particular class, shit happens. I also know there are a lot of developers (I was once one of these) who believe they're almost 'too good' at coding therefore refuse to use them entirely on that basis.</p>
<p>The former is why I disliked frameworks. I had been involved in a project where a developer had clearly used Bootstrap to save time without considering the vast amount of crappy code they had used. I had the unfortunate job of trying to decipher it.</p>
<p>I am no longer of the too-good-at-coding disposition either. Them developers who are being snotty towards frameworks are the ones that are spending more time rewriting code that could be spent making the web a better place (or having a pint with your mates - whatever floats your boat).</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>So as it turns out: CSS frameworks are not <em>all</em> that bad. They have sped up my workflow dramatically and have helped me get projects off the ground, giving me more time to deal with bugs and niggles during the "last 10%".</p>
<p>I'm not speaking for every framework out there. I know there are a lot of bad ones - Bootstrap being one of them. I am also presuming there are other good ones and I think these are the ones that developers should spend their time finding and adopting. Time is money and cutting workflow time means more pints. Simple.</p>
