<p>Having ditched jQuery over a year ago, I have found that in most situations there is usually a vanilla solution to a problem. Well, at least there seems to be for everything besides custom select boxes. Select2 and Selectize are popular options that serve their purpose well but both come with the burdening jQuery dependency.</p>

<p>Searching for an opportunity to introduce Redux and the <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.md">"single source of truth"</a> principle into my work, I decided to develop my own solution that is configurable, lightweight and, most importantly, written entirely in vanilla JavaScript.</p>
