<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a relatively new design and development approach for the web that seeks to optimise websites through fluidity and flexibility, to best suite a device’s screen width (or browser viewport), so the user can receive a web experience which is best suited to the device being used. By rearranging layout elements of a website based on certain browser widths, content can fit within the boundaries of a device, meaning a user will not have to “zoom” in on their mobile or tablet screen when viewing a website to see the content desired.<br />
<a href="http://joshuajohnson.co.uk/content/uploads/2013/11/responsive.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-314" alt="Example of the responsive Leeds RAG website" src="assets/responsive.png" width="1000" height="531" /></a><br />
Coined in 2010 by <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Ethan Marcotte</a>, RWD sought to overcome the difficulty of “designing for mice and keyboards, for T9 keypads, for handheld game controllers, for touch interfaces” brought about by the mass proliferation of new devices with built-in standards compliant web browsers. Before responsive websites, web design and development were notoriously based around a set width of ‘960’ pixels; a width that fitted neatly within the constraints of smaller PC monitors with the simplistic assumption that most users would not have screens much smaller or larger than that set width. However, due to the mass popularity of mobile devices of all shapes and sizes, it has become clear that having only one set width will not accommodate a certain proportion of users, leaving the rest with a poor user experience. By adopting a design and development approach that allows for a website to scale up or down depending on the browser width (without breaking the layout and maintaining design), websites can become far more accessible for users who's primary device is not the traditional PC.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, like most new advancements in technology, there is a divide between the people who think RWD it is the best thing since sliced bread and those who believe it is merely a fad. Now I’m positioned somewhat in the middle of them two opinions and i’ll explain why.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is near-on impossible to claim RWD is a fad. It isn't a new CSS trick that will have its 15 minutes of fame and then reside to the pool of other "fun" things websites can do but no developers actually use (parallax scrolling, I'm looking at you). RWD not only changes how developers develop;  it changes how designers design; it changes what tools we use; it changes our workflow and above all, it changes how users experience the websites we produce. No longer is design and development two different areas of the office or even different people. RWD blurs the lines between what is web design and what is web development and this will fundamentally change the industry and cement itself for the long haul. Designing within the browser has and will continue to offer powerful possibilities when producing responsive websites and will move our industry away from '1000px' width Photoshop or Firework (RIP) comps towards fluid designs.</p>
<p>On the other hand however, RWD is not the quintessential answer to all our problems. Although by producing responsive websites you are making less assumptions about what devices people are using, you are on the flip-side making the assumption that all users, on all devices want to receive all the content that a website offers. The alternative to responsive websites for many has been the idea of having a tailored mobile version of a website that displays on mobile devices but not on more traditional devices (see <a href="http://m.facebook.com" target="_blank">m.facebook.com</a>), an idea with good intentions but often executed poorly. As a result of this poor execution, mobile specific websites have earned the reputation of being "dumbed down" websites that restrict users not only in functionality but also in the content available.</p>
<p>I feel the future of web development is going to be a responsive one. The continuing popularity and affordability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets will eventually force the hand for developers who are yet to incorporate the process into their workflow</p>
